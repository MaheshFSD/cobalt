It was the first day we three decided to split the landing page and started working. After working for two days we made it good. Exactly looking like the original website. But here comes the challenge, when we merged the files on github, we were not able to complete the process and lost our data that we created. Seeing this we created another repository to merge the files. On the third day it was the time to recreate the whole project and we decided to stick with minimum number of pages as we don't have much time. So, Mahesh decided to design the home page, me (Rajath Sahu) and Sri Harsha decided to make a page each. Mahesh helped us in creating those pages. Finally we were able to design three pages Home page, Login page, and Signup page. Now we know how to deal with git and publish successfully.

Thank you for your time.
