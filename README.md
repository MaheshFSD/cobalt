It was the first day we three decided to split the landing page. As we three have different way of coding so there were some issues we faced after merging the files. After working for almost two days on the home page when we merged the files on github, we faced challenges as we were not able to complete the process and lost our data that we created. Seeing this we created another repository to merge the files. On the third day it was the time to recreate the whole project and we decided to stick with minimum number of pages as we don't have much time. So, Mahesh decided to design the home page and me and Sri Harsha will work on the other pages. Mahesh helped us in creating those pages. Finally we were able to design three pages Home page, Login page, and Signup page.
